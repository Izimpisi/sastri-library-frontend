            Sastri College Principal Message
            Sastri College is co-educational state secondary school with learners from grade 8 to grade 12. The founding of Sastri College was the vision of V.S Srinivasa Sastri with the official opening of the school taking place on Monday, 14th October 1929 by the Earl of Athlone, Governor General of South Africa.

            The school is located on the periphery of the central business district of the City of Durban. It is a school rich in tradition and respected for its high academic achievement. These have been handed down to us through the dedication and vision of our predecessors which continues to inspire us today.

            S. Rajcoomar

            We are a progressive school, encouraging the holistic development of all our learners with high expectations of good discipline and a continuous striving for improvement in academic excellence from every learner. We have a superb, dedicated, enthusiastic teaching team where the focus is on the development of each learner to reach their full potential. The school offers a variety of extra-curricular and co-curricular activities and all learners are encouraged to participate. We are committed to strengthening leadership amongst our learners by giving them a voice in the daily life of the school. The high standards evident throughout the school are the result of the professionalism of our staff coupled with the commitment and energy of our Learners, Parents, School Governing Body and very active Alumni association.
            I am delighted to welcome you to the Sastri College website. This website presents an invitation for everyone to experience a ‘snap shot’ of the vibrancy of our school life. Our vision is to work in partnership with everyone including our learners, parents, other schools and the community at large, to create a positive and inclusive environment for high quality learning and teaching where everyone is valued and respected.
